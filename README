NAME
    Progress::Any::Output::LogAny - Output progress to Log::Any

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.04 of Progress::Any::Output::LogAny
    (from Perl distribution Progress-Any-Output-LogAny), released on
    2014-07-29.

SYNOPSIS
     use Progress::Any::Output;

     Progress::Any::Output->set("LogAny",
         logger   => $log,
         template => '(%c/%C) %m',
     );

DESCRIPTION
    This output sends progress update to Log::Any. Only progress update()
    containing message will be logged, unless "has_message_only" attribute
    is set to false. Logging is done at loglevel "debug", but when update
    "level" is set to "high", message will be logged at loglevel "info".
    When update "level" is set to "low", message will be logged at loglevel
    "trace".

METHODS
  new(%args) => OBJ
    Instantiate. Usually called through
    "Progress::Any::Output->set("LogAny", %args)".

    Known arguments:

    *   logger => OBJ

        Logger object to use. Defaults to "Log::Any->get_logger()".

    *   template => STR (default: '(%c/%C) %m')

        Will be used to do "$progress->fill_template()". See Progress::Any
        for supported template strings.

    *   has_message_only => BOOL (default: 1)

        By default, when set to 1, will cause output to only log progress
        update()'s which contains message. If set to 0, will log all
        progress update()'s.
